# Hill_and_Valley_Prediction
Project Overview:

Ever come across a dataset that's a bit... messy? Like, it has some unexpected words or symbols where numbers should be? This Colab notebook is here to help! It tackles the challenge of cleaning up a dataset so you can analyze it with ease. In this case, we'll specifically deal with a tricky character named "Medium" that's causing some trouble.

Getting Started (Installation):

Good news, you don't need to install anything extra to run this notebook! Colab already comes with all the tools we need. But if you're curious, here are the libraries we'll be using:

pandas: This is like a fancy spreadsheet that helps us organize and manipulate data.
scikit-learn: This one's a machine learning toolkit, but don't worry, we're just using a small part of it for data cleaning today.
Running the Notebook:

Click it, Run it! Go ahead and click "Runtime" in the top menu, then select "Run all cells." This will execute all the code in the notebook, step by step.
Let the Magic Happen: Sit back, relax, and watch the notebook work its magic on your dataset. It will clean up the "Medium" issue and get your data ready for further exploration.
Understanding the Code (Optional):

If you're curious about the code itself, feel free to explore! Each cell is like a mini-instruction that tells the computer what to do. You can click on a cell and hit "Shift+Enter" to run just that cell and see what happens.

Bonus Tip:

This notebook focuses on the "Medium" value, but the techniques used can be applied to other unexpected characters or values you might encounter in your data cleaning adventures!
